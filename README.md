# React Portfolio :

Welcome to my full stack portfolio! I designed a responsive website to show off the different projects I have been working on. I used React to create a mobile responsive portfolio. Feel free to take a look at how I used React to create my website.

## Self imposed rules

Updated Portfolio:
* Links to your GitHub profile & LinkedIn page as well as your email address and phone number
* A link to a PDF of your resume with updated projects
* A list of projects. For each project, make sure you have the following:
* Project title
* Link to the deployed version
* Link to the GitHub repository
* GIF or screenshot of the deployed application

Design:
* Mobile-first design
* Choose a color palette for your site so it doesn't just look like the default bootstrap theme or an unstyled HTML site.
* Make sure the font size is large enough to read, and that the colors don't cause eye strain.

 Portfolio includes the following:
* A Header component that appears on multiple pages
* A single Project component that will be used multiple times on a single page

# React

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
